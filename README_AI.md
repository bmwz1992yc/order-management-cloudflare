# AI-Oriented Technical Documentation for the Cloudflare Order Management System

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a simple, serverless Order Management System built on the Cloudflare ecosystem. It allows users to upload images of handwritten orders, uses an AI model to parse the image data into structured JSON, and stores this data in Cloudflare R2. The entire application is managed by a single Cloudflare Worker.

- **Backend**: A Cloudflare Worker (`index.js`) acting as an API server.
- **Frontend**: A single-file, vanilla JavaScript application (`index.html`) served directly by the worker.
- **Database**: Cloudflare R2 is used as the data store for order data, configuration, and uploaded images.
- **AI Integration**: Connects to either Google Gemini or any OpenAI-compatible API for image-to-text and data extraction.

---

## 2. File Structure

- `wrangler.toml`: The configuration file for the Cloudflare Worker. It defines the worker's name, main entry point (`index.js`), site assets (`./`), and R2 bucket bindings.
- `index.js`: The backend. This is the Cloudflare Worker script that contains all the server-side logic, including API routing, data storage operations, and communication with external AI APIs.
- `index.html`: The frontend. This single file contains all the HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript required for the user interface and user interactions.

## 3. Backend Deep Dive (`index.js`)

The worker script is self-contained and uses no external npm packages. It functions as a JSON API server.

### R2 Storage Schema

- **Orders Data**: A single JSON file stores an array of all order objects.
  - **Key**: `orders/orders_data.json`
- **System Configuration**: A single JSON file stores the AI provider settings.
  - **Key**: `system/config.json`
- **Order Images**: Each uploaded order image is stored as a separate object.
  - **Key Prefix**: `images/`
  - **Key Format**: `images/{order_id}-{original_filename}`

| `GET`  | `/`                     | Serves the frontend `index.html` file.                                                                                                                                   |
| `POST` | `/api/upload`           | **Main Workflow.** Receives an image file, calls the AI API to parse it, generates a new order ID (`YYYYMMDD-NN` format), and saves the order data and image to R2. |

## 4. Frontend Deep Dive (`index.html`)

The frontend is a vanilla JavaScript Single Page Application (SPA). All HTML, CSS, and JS are in this single file.

### Core Logic & Rendering

1.  **Initialization**: On `window.onload`, the app calls `loadConfig()` and `fetchOrders()`.
2.  **Data Fetching**: `fetchOrders()` retrieves all orders from the `/api/orders` endpoint and stores them in a global `allOrders` array.
3.  **Filter Population**: After fetching, `populateCustomerFilter()` is called. It extracts unique customer names from `allOrders` and dynamically creates the checkbox-based multi-select filter.
4.  **Rendering Pipeline**:
    -   Any user interaction with filter controls (e.g., changing a date, checking a customer box) triggers the `renderOrders()` function.
    -   `renderOrders()` is the heart of the UI. It **does not** re-fetch data. Instead, it:
        a.  Creates a fresh copy of the `allOrders` array.
        b.  **Applies Filters**: It sequentially filters this array based on the current state of all filter controls (selected customers, date ranges).
        c.  **Renders HTML**: Finally, it clears the table body (`<tbody>`) and iterates through the filtered array to build and inject the HTML table rows (`<tr>` and `<td>`).

### Key UI Components & Interactions

-   **AI Config**: A collapsible form to set the AI provider details. Saved via `POST /api/config`.
-   **Order Upload**: A simple form to upload an image. Triggers the `POST /api/upload` workflow.
-   **Action Bar**: A row of buttons above the main filter controls for primary actions:
    -   **Quick Date Filters**: Buttons for "Today", "Yesterday", "Day Before Yesterday", and "Last 5 Days" that populate the date filter inputs.
    -   **Export**: Buttons to export the current view to CSV or a self-contained HTML file.
-   **Filters**: A control panel above the table allows for dynamic, client-side filtering of the displayed orders.
    -   **Customer Filter**: A custom-built, checkbox-based multi-select dropdown.
    -   **Date Filters**: Two sets of start/end date inputs for "Order Date" and "Upload Date".
-   **Editable Table**: Order data in the table (like customer name, item details, etc.) is editable. Double-clicking a cell turns it into an input field. On blur or Enter, the `POST /api/order/update` endpoint is called to save the change.

## 5. Development Environment

-   The project is managed using Cloudflare's `wrangler` CLI.
-   To run a local development server that simulates the Cloudflare environment, use the command:
    ```bash
    wrangler dev
    ```

## 6. Development Progress & History

- **Initial Setup**: Project started with a basic Cloudflare Worker for image upload and AI parsing.
- **Bug Fix (Build Error)**: Corrected a JavaScript syntax error in `index.js` related to improper string quoting (`''''` vs ````json`).
- **UI/UX Improvement (Column Fix)**: Fixed a column misalignment issue in the order table by refactoring the row rendering logic in `index.html` to ensure correct cell order.
- **Feature Addition (Order ID Logic)**: Changed the order ID generation logic from a timestamp-based `OD-` prefix to a more readable date-based sequential format (`YYYYMMDD-NN`).
- **Feature Addition (Sorting & Filtering)**:
    - Added initial server-side sorting and client-side filter/sort controls.
    - Refactored the frontend rendering logic to be state-based (using a global `allOrders` array) and separated data fetching from rendering (`fetchOrders` vs `renderOrders`).
- **Bug Fix & Feature Enhancement (Filters/Sort)**:
    - Fixed a bug where the client-side sorting was not being applied correctly after selection.
    - Upgraded the customer filter from a simple text input to a multi-select list.
    - Upgraded the date filter to support date ranges for both "Order Date" and "Upload Date".
- **UI/UX Improvement (Advanced Filters)**:
    - Replaced the standard multi-select list with a more user-friendly custom dropdown component with checkboxes.
    - Adjusted table column widths to improve layout and readability.
- **UI/UX & Bug Fix (Filter Layout)**: Refactored the filter and action button layout using Flexbox to fix alignment, overlap, and sizing issues. Corrected a bug in the `renderOrders` function that prevented filters from being applied correctly.
- **Feature Removal (Sorting)**: Removed the client-side sorting functionality and its associated UI to simplify the interface and provide more space for filtering controls.
- **Feature Addition (Quick Filters)**: Added "Today", "Yesterday", "Day Before Yesterday", and "Last 5 Days" buttons for rapid filtering of orders by date.
- **Enhancement (CSV Export)**: Fixed a character encoding bug to ensure correct display of non-ASCII characters in Excel. Modified the export to include full, clickable image URLs instead of internal R2 keys.
- **Feature Addition (HTML Export)**: Implemented a new feature to export the order list as a self-contained HTML file with images embedded as Base64 data. The export function respects all active filters.
- **Bug Fix (HTML Export)**: Corrected a bug in the HTML export feature that caused only a single order to be processed and exported.
- **Documentation**:
    - Created this `README_AI.md` file to document the project for AI assistants and added this progress section.
